Repository contains experimental Selenide automated tests of GitHub Selenide repo and "The Internet" web page (https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/drag_and_drop).

The autotests are divided into classes and check:

1) that Andrei Solntsev is the most active contributor;
2) that Selenide repo wiki has a SoftAssertions page and a code example;
3) that Selenide's dragAndDropTo() method works on "The Internet" page.
